Nintendo, if you want me to take this down, please email me at wiimartshopping@gmail.com
(please don't though I love this)

WiiMart is the first ever Wii Shop Channel revival that lasted more than a week and still wasn't nuked!
You can find its source code here.

# Download
The cIOSes are [here](https://ocarinaoftime.github.io/WiiMart/cIOS/) while WiiMart's WAD [here](https://ocarinaoftime.github.io/WiiMart/wad/).
In the meantime, [join the Discord!](https://dsc.gg/WiiMart)

# Installation
Downloading WiiMart varies on what platform you are on.

- Console

Download the WiiMart WAD and the patched IOS WAD for your console type (Wii/vWii). We recommend [YAWMME](https://oscwii.org/library/app/yawmME) for installing WADs.
-# vWii is the Wii U's Wii Mode
You can install both WADs normally, but if they give you an error such as `-1022` or `-1029` you can delete the existing title then install. Press `-` to mark the channel for uninstallation, and then mark it with `+` for installation.

- Dolphin

*For those with Wii NAND backups*

Install both the WiiMart WAD and the patched IOS WAD (for Wii). Install by going to `Tools` and `Install WAD`. You can then go to the Wii Menu by going to `Tools` and then `Load Wii System Menu 4.3X`.

*For those without Wii NAND backups*

So far, getting the shop on a blank NAND has been unsuccesful.
